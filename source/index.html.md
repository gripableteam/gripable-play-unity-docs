# Introduction

Gripable Play Unity is a Unity Package developed by gripAble Ltd. 
It exposes the Gripable API through Unity, allowing developers with access to a GripAble Play device & Android tablet to start developing games.

# Setup

To get started with Gripable Play Unity, follow the steps [here](https://bitbucket.org/gripable/gripable-play-unity/src/master/README.md).

# Releases

Check out from these links the documentation for the released versions of Gripable Play Unity.

<aside class="warning">This documentation is for features still in development! Check out the documentation for the latest released version from the links below.</aside>

## Releases

* [1.0.0](https://gripableteam.github.io/gripable-play-unity-docs-1.0.0)

# Accessing the Gripable Plugin

The Gripable Plugin is statically accessed to retrieve the main ojects needed to interface with the Gripable Play device. At the moment the Gripable Plugin allows you to retrieve up to two available Gripable Play devices and the UDP Client Manager. The Gripable Plugin does not need any setup and can be called statically when needed.

## Play1

> Play1 returns a reference to the first Gripable Play device.

```csharp
GripablePlay gripablePlay = Gripable.Play1;
```

The first Gripable Play device is accessed via the static attribute Play1, which returns a <code>GripablePlay</code> object.

## Play2

The second Gripable Play device is accessed via the static attribute Play2, which returns a <code>GripablePlay</code> object.

> Play2 returns a reference to the second Gripable Play device.

```csharp
GripablePlay secondGripablePlay = Gripable.Play2;
```

## UdpManager

> Returns a reference to the UDP Client Manager.

```csharp
UdpClientManager udpManager = Gripable.UdpManager;
```

Returns a reference to the [UDP Client Manager](#using-udpclientmanager), used to send serialised data from the connected Gripable Play devices to a machine through UDP.

# Connecting and Disconnecting

In order to connect to a Gripable Play device, it must first be discovered by the Android device. This is achieved by turning on the Gripable Play and using the Android OS to scan for Bluetooth devices.
The <code>GripablePlay</code> object provides a wrapper around the underlying [Android BLE stack](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/connectivity/bluetooth-le). 

<aside class="notice">
In the future, Bluetooth devices will be scanned automatically without the Android OS.
</aside>

## SetBluetoothDevice()

```csharp
void SetBluetoothDevice(BluetoothDeviceAndroid bluetoothDevice);
```

> Sets a Bluetooth Device to the <code>GripablePlay</code> object.

```csharp
string macAdress = "F3:FC:A9:B1:36:BD";
BluetoothDeviceAndroid bluetoothDevice = AndroidHelper.GetBluetoothDevice(macAddress);
gripablePlay.SetBluetoothDevice(bluetoothDevice);
```

Setting a Bluetooth Device, with a specified MAC address, to the <code>GripablePlay</code> object. Setting a Bluetooth Device for the first time flags the <code>GripablePlay</code> as initialized. Resetting the Bluetooth Device additional times is used to connect the <code>GripablePlay</code> object to a different Gripable Play device (i.e. with a different MAC adress).

# Connection Events

> To subscribe a handler to an event, assign a reference to an encapsulated method which has no parameters and no return value.

```csharp
class MyView : MonoBehaviour {

  private GripablePlay _gripablePlay;

  Awake(){
    // make sure you have a reference to your Gripable Play before trying to assign to it
    _gripablePlay.OnConnected += DoSomethingWhenTheGripableConnectes    
  }
 
  public void DoSomethingWhenTheGripableConnects(){
    Debug.Log("YAY, the Gripable has connected")
  }
}
```

 <code>GripablePlay</code> has a series of [Action Delegate](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.action?view=netframework-4.7.2) connection events, which are fired at different stages of the connection process.


Callback Name | Triggered
--------- | -------
<code>OnConnected</code> | Device has been successfully connected and is ready.
<code>OnDisconnect</code> | Device has been fully disconnected.
<code>OnConnecting</code> | Device is attempting to connect.
<code>OnDisconnecting</code> | Device is attempting to disconnect. 


# Gestures

> To subscribe a handler to an event, assign a reference to an encapsulated method which has no parameters and no return value.

```csharp
class MyView : MonoBehaviour {

  private GripablePlay _gripablePlay;

  Awake(){
    // make sure you have a reference to your Gripable Play before trying to assign to it
    _gripablePlay.OnSqueeze += DoSomethingWhenTheGripableIsSqueezed  
    _gripablePlay.OnRelease += DoSomethingWhenTheGripableIsReleased  
  }
 
  public void DoSomethingWhenTheGripableIsSqueezed(){
    Debug.Log("YAY, the Gripable has been squeezed")
  }

  public void DoSomethingWhenTheGripableIsReleased(){
    Debug.Log("YAY, the Gripable has been squeezed")
  }
}
```

 <code>GripablePlay</code> has a series of [Action Delegate](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.action?view=netframework-4.7.2) gesture events, which are triggered when the Gripable detects specific, predefined movements. In particular, these gesture events divide into Force Gestures and Rotational Gestures.

## Force Gestures Callbacks

Force Gestures are triggered when interacting with the finger bar on the Gripable Play, for example when squeezing or releasing the finger bar.

Callback Name | Triggered
--------- | -------
<code>OnSqueeze</code> | When the device is squeezed, more specifically when the Grip Force reading goes from a <code>MIN_THRESHOLD</code> to a <code>MAX_THRESHOLD</code> within a given time period.
<code>OnRelease</code> | When the device is released, more specifically when the Grip Force reading goes from a <code>MAX_THRESHOLD</code> to a <code>MIN_THRESHOLD</code> within a given time period.

## Rotation Gestures Callbacks

Rotation Gestures are triggered when the user rotates the Gripable Play device through two specified angular regions within a specified time threshold. Currently, all regions are defined by two angles around a specific axis in the [sensor frame](#sensor-frame).

Callback Name | Triggered
--------- | -------
<code>OnSupination</code> | When the device is rotated around the X axis in the positive direction. 
<code>OnPronation</code> | When the device is rotated around the X axis in the negative direction. 
<code>OnUlnar</code> | When the device is rotated around the Y axis in the positive direction. 
<code>OnRadial</code> | When the device is rotated around the Y axis in the negative direction. 
<code>OnExtension</code> | When the device is rotated around the Z axis in the positive direction. 
<code>OnFlexion</code> | When the device is rotated around the Z axis in the negative direction.
<code>OnNeutralRoll</code> | When the device's X rotation has returned to its starting position.
<code>OnNeutralPitch</code> | When the device's Y rotation has returned to its starting position.
<code>OnNeutralYaw</code> | When the device's Z rotation has returned to its starting position.

## Gesture Types

```csharp
enum GestureType
{
    SQUEEZE,
    RELEASE,
    FLEXION,
    EXTENSION,
    PRONATION,
    SUPINATION,
    ULNAR,
    RADIAL,
    NEUTRAL_YAW,
    NEUTRAL_ROLL,
    NEUTRAL_PITCH
}
```

To configure gestures, the desired gesture type must be specified. The list of available gestures is defined by the <code>GestureType enum</code>.

## ConfigureForceGesture()

```csharp
bool ConfigureForceGesture(
  GestureType gestureType,
  float releaseThreshold,
  float squeezeThreshold,
  int timeThreshold
);
```

> Configures the force and time thresholds for the specified force gesture.

```csharp
GripablePlay gp = Gripable.Play1;
float releaseForce = 0.5f;
float squeezeForce = 1f;
int timeThreshold = 5000;

gp.ConfigureForceGesture(
  GestureType.SQUEEZE,
  releaseForce, 
  squeezeForce, 
  timeThreshold
);
```

Configures the force and time thresholds for the specified force gesture. In the example, the squeeze gesture is configured to trigger when 0.5 Kg to at least 1 Kg of pressure force is detected on the finger bar, within 5 seconds.

### Query Parameters and Return Values

Parameter | Returns | Description
--------- | ------- | -----------
<code>gestureType</code>, <code>releaseThreshold</code>, <code>squeezeThreshold</code>, <code>timeThreshold</code> | <code>true</code> | Configures the gesture with the specified <code>GestureType</code> with the specified release and squeeze force thresholds (<code>float</code>) and time threshold (<code>int</code>), returns <code>true</code> if the configuration succeeded
<code>gestureType</code>, <code>releaseThreshold</code>, <code>squeezeThreshold</code>, <code>timeThreshold</code> | <code>false</code> | Configures the gesture with the specified <code>GestureType</code> with the specified release and squeeze force thresholds (<code>float</code>) and time threshold (<code>int</code>), returns <code>false</code> if the configuration was incorrect

## ConfigureRotationGesture()

```csharp
bool ConfigureRotationGesture(
  GestureType gestureType,
  Region regionA,
  Region regionB,
  int timeThreshold
);
```

> Configures the regions and the time threshold for the specified rotation gesture.

```csharp
GripablePlay gp = Gripable.Play1;
Region regionA = new Region(350, 10);
Region regionB = new Region(60, 90);
int timeThreshold = 5000;

gp.ConfigureRotationGesture(
    GestureType.EXTENSION,
    regionA,
    regionB,
    timeThreshold
);
```

Configuring a gesture with ConfigureRotationGesture requires a start region, end region and timeThreshold. 
Each region is defined by a start and end angle. An angle is considered in the region if it exists between the start and end angle, traced anti-clockwise around a circle.

In the example, the extension gesture is configured such that the start region (neutral position in this case) is set from 350 and 10 degrees (including 0 degrees), and the end region (extended position) is set from 60 to 90 degrees. If the Gripable Play device's pitch changes from a value within the start region to a value in the end region in less than the time threshold, the OnExtension event is triggered and any attached handlers are called.

### Query Parameters and Return Values

Parameter | Returns | Description
--------- | ------- | -----------
 <code>gestureType</code>, <code>regionA</code>, <code>regionB</code>, <code>timeThreshold</code> | <code>true</code> | Configures the gesture with the specified <code>GestureType</code> with the specified start and end regions (<code>Region</code>) and time threshold (<code>int</code>), returns <code>true</code> if the configuration succeeds
 <code>gestureType</code>, <code>regionA</code>, <code>regionB</code>, <code>timeThreshold</code> | <code>false</code> | Configures the gesture with the specified <code>GestureType</code> with the specified start and end regions (<code>Regions</code>) and time threshold (<code>int</code>), returns <code>false</code> if the configuration was incorrect

# Frames of Reference

Two different frames of reference can be used when working with the deice position and orientation: world frame and sensor frame.

## World Frame

The world frame of reference is the static frame of reference, independent of the device orientation.

![World frame animated](potato-world-frame.gif)

## Sensor Frame

The sensor frame is the frame relative to the device itself.

# The Test View

The Test View is an optional UI tool used to show the data coming from each connected Gripable Play, as well as allowing basic actions to be performed on them. It is responsive to different screen layouts and resolutions and updates automatically every time the screen orientation changes (landscape/portrait mode).

## Structure

The Test View shows data and allows actions to be performed on two Gripable Plays at the same time, corresponing to the <code>Gripable.Play1</code> and <code>Gripable.Play2</code> objects.

For each of the connected Gripable Plays, several tabs are available in the Test View, grouping together data and actions of similar nature.

In order to open the Test View for one of the two Gripable Plays, the corresponing button on the left (top on portrait mode) must be selected. Similarly, tabs for a specific Gripable Play can be navigated through the buttons on the left (bottom on portrait mode), as shown in the picture below:

The tabs available in the Test View are as follows:

* **General tab** shows the basic device info, allows for the connection/disconnection of the Gripable Play and to start/stop the UDP Client.
* **Grip Data tab** shows data from the grip sensor, as well as allowing subscription.
* **World Frame Data tab** shows orientation data in the world frame, as well as allowing subscription.
* **Sensor Frame Data tab** shows orientation data in the sensor frame, as well as allowing subscription.
* **Motion Data tab** shows all motion data coming from the sensors (accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer), as well as allowing subscription.
* **Force Gestures tab** shows a trigger count for the force gestures, as well as allowing their threshold configuration.
* **Roll Gestures tab**, **Pitch Gestures tab** and **Yaw Gestures tab** show a trigger count for the rotation gestures on the three axes, as well as allowing their threshold configuration.

## Usage

In order to use the Test View into a project, the <code>TestView</code> prefab (found inside <code>GripablePlayResources/TestView/</code>) must be dragged inside the scene.

This will open up the Test View UI at runtime. The Test View can be closed through the X button on the top left and re-opened by touching anywhere on the screen with at least three fingers at the same time. Once a Gripable Play is connected through the *Connection panel* in the *General tab*, all other panels can be used for that Gripable Play.

If the project makes use of just one Gripable Play and does not need the Test View for both Gripable Plays, a Test View for just one Gripable Play can be used instead. In order to do so, instead of the <code>TestView</code> prefab, the <code>PlayView</code> prefab must be dragged into the scene. In this scenario, the <code>PlayView</code> GameObject must also be flagged as the root Test View and the Gripable Play source (<code>Gripable.Play1</code> or <code>Gripable.Play2</code>) must be specified from the inspector (both options can be found under the *TestView settings* section). In the picture below, a Play View for <code>Gripable.Play1</code> is set in the scene:

The **Connection panel** and the **UDP Client panel** in the *General tab* can be configured from the inspector in order to have a default MAC address and IP address and port, respectively. This can be done by expanding the hierarchy of the <code>TestView</code> GameObject in the scene until the GameObjects <code>ConnectionPanel</code> and <code>UdpClientPanel</code> (under <code>GeneralTab</code> and in the first and second rows, respectively), for each <code>PlayView</code> GameObject, as shown in the pictures below.
